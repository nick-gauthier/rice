# Analysis code for "Projected warming will exceed the fundamental thermal niche of rice cultivation"

Manuscript available [here](https://github.com/nick-gauthier/rice/blob/main/main.qmd). This notebook includes the main text, online methods, and generates all the main and supplementary figures from preprocessed data.

Data preprocessing and computationally intensive analyses available [here](https://github.com/nick-gauthier/rice/blob/main/methods.qmd). Code for the genetic offset analysis is available at [this repository](https://github.com/ornobalam/riceGenomicOffset).

Supplementary analyses and older versions of the main analyses are archived [here](https://github.com/nick-gauthier/rice/blob/main/extras/) temporarily, but are subject to change and reorganization.
